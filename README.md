- 👋 Hi, I’m Jodi Ladoucer and @JoJo-designs on github. I graduated from a graphic design program in 2020 and then I stated a full-Stack bootcamp the next year. 

- 👀 I’m interested in web development and graphic design. I enjoy music and sailing and when it is nice outside I sometimes take my dog for a walk or go on a ride on my longboard. 

- 🌱 I’m currently looking for oppertunityies to work and improve my skills. I feel a little more confortables with front-end technogies like HtMl CSS and React, but I want to try and push myself alittle more into the backend technolgies.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on. I have nothing at the moment but I'm sure that will change.

- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me by email at jodiladouceur.design@gmail.com or on linkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodi-ladouceur/
