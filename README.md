- 👋 Hi, I’m Jodi Ladoucer and @JoJo-designs on github. I graduated from a graphic design program in 2020 and then I decame a full-stack web developer earlier this year.. 

- 👀 I’m interested in web development and graphic design. I enjoy music and sailing and when it is nice outside I sometimes take my dog for a walk or go on a ride on my longboard. I also enjoy creative activities like drawing and playing guitar.

- 🌱 I’m currently looking for oppertunityies to work and improve my skills. I feel a little more confortables with front-end technogies like HtMl CSS and React, but I want to try and push myself alittle more into the backend technolgies. I have started to volunteer for a startup and I am hopeing that I can learn alot from it.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on. I am helping volunteer for a startup that build websites for none profits.
