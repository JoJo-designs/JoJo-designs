- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoJo-designs

- 👀 I’m interested in web development and graphic design. I like sailing and music. I am not really picky about the genre of music but when I am codeing I tend to  listen to music in another lauguage. I like to watch anime, reading manga, and playing video games. When it is nice outside I sometimes go and ride my longboard along a waterfront trail in my area. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use node.js to run a javascript file on my computer without a web broswer. I am going to start a project that will use javascript and node to build a generator that will make good quility readme files.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on. I have nothing at the moment but I'm sure that will change.

- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me by email at jodiladouceur.design@gmail.com
